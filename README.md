 I love watching YouTube whenever I am eating something. My favorite YouTuber is Casey Neistat, I also like watching Mr. Beast.
* [jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/)
 I love playing jstris since it is a faster paced version of tetris and is more competitive in my opinon. Whenever I find myself bored I often turn to jstris and play it.
